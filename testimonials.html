				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4">
							<blockquote>
								<p>My Surgeon, the fantastic Mr. Alam. I would highly recommend to anyone considering utilising his expertise
								if you have knee issues. You can self refer privately or, like me, ask to be referred by the NHS.
								</p>
								<footer class="pull-right text-info">25th September 2016 at Highgate Hospital Ltd</footer>
							</blockquote>
				
							<blockquote>
								<p>The surgery and after care has been exceptional. Dr Alam has been amazing. He is an extremely easy doctor to talk to who takes the time to listen to my concerns. After leaving my appointment with him I left very happy.
								</p>
								<footer class="pull-right text-info">20th September 2016 at Highgate Hospital Ltd</footer>

							<blockquote>
								<p>Mr Mahbub Alam performed my total hip replacement in August 2016, the care I received whilst in hospital and the aftercare were outstanding, I am hoping to return to Mr Alam to have my second hip replacement in the near future.
								</p>

							</blockquote>
				
							<blockquote>
								<p>Mr Alam completed my revision ACL reconstruction earlier this year. He listened to my needs, questions, and anxieties with great care and was able to attend to all of these sympathetically. Mr Alam explained the procedures and situations in great detail, including with visual aids. At this point I am very satisfied with the outcome of my operation. Mr Alam has performed a wonderful job. I highly recommend Mr Alam for orthopaedic surgery, not just for his skill and expertise, but also for his personable manner and sympathetic ear.

								<p>A note to say thank you for your kindness and attention towards me during my Total Knee Replacement. It has gone really well!

							<blockquote>
								<p>My gp and orthopaedic doctors all wanted me to have a Total Knee Replacement. Mr Alam immediately recognised how active I was, that I wanted to keep skiing and keep working. He suggested a Partial or Unicompartmental Knee Replacement. And 3 months later... Back at work and in the gym. Getting ready for skiing soon!

							<blockquote>
								<p>At my first consultation at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, February 2016 Dr Mahbub Alam was a very considerate and understanding Consultant. He explained carefully diagnosis of my right hip arthritis and how pain could be alleviated. He gave full & clear explanation of the process of hip replacement and gave me plenty of time to ask questions and patiently explained at my level of understanding and also showed x-rays of the condition. Estimated operation date came on time and Dr Alam came to the ward at King George hospital before it took place to recap on what was going to happen. He returned when I was in recovery and explained it was now my turn to capitalise on the work performed by him and his Team and to take advantage of the after-care which would be provided at home. Today (6th July 2016) follow up visit after recovery and he was just as attentive and reassuring about my continued progress and would inform my GP of the result. You couldn’t ask for a kinder or more caring Doctor.

							<blockquote>
								<p>I found Mr. Alam most helpful in all respects during my stay in hospital, & he answered all my questions in a professional & understandable manner. He explained that following the knee replacement operation my knee would be extremely painful & swollen, but that this would be reduced by the use of pain killing drugs, until the pain became bearable. This proved to be the case, thank God ! Looking at the X-Rays, showing how the bones in my leg which were at an angle to one another, are now absolutely vertical - what a fantastic & brilliant job!
